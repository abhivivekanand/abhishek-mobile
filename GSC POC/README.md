# Nasa Gsc POC is a NASA APOD Viwer
This Application runs on Android and shows you different Photos & Video released by NASA everyday. 
You can see the Yesterday day image as well.
You can add any image or video as a favourite. We only store the Date as Favourite instead of image. You will receive confirmation message on adding Favourite. 
We have three section i.e. NASA Centre where we can see the images, second section is Search where you can search an image by providing date in YYYY-MM-DD format and third section is your Favourite section where you can see the Favourite image Dates and on click that image will get reload. (Reload work is pending). 
We have provided a good look and feel. 
We have tried to provide some security as well by wiriting Rooted device detection mechanism. 
Small amount of unit test cases are also added.
